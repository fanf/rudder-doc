=== Node properties

Node properties can be found in the "properties" tab of each node in Rudder.

Node properties can be modified using Rudder API, see http://www.rudder-project.org/rudder-api-doc/#api-Nodes-updateNodeProperties

Properties can be seen as a list of key=value pairs. 

The value can be a string or a well formatter JSON data structure. 

Example: `datacenter=Paris`. `datacenter= { "Europe": { "France": "Paris" } }`


==== Using properties

You can use a node property almost everywhere in Rudder:

* in directive parameters
* in the technique editor
* in your own techniques an generic methods code

To use a property, simply use the variable node.properties with the variable call syntax.

Example with a string property named datacenter:

----

${node.properties[datacenter]}

----

WARNING: Currently node properties can not be used in JavaScript expressions (see following paragraph), since they are evaluated during policy generation and node properties are only made available in the agents. Starting with Rudder 3.1.14, you can enable a feature swith in "Administration / Setting" to allow node properties expansion in directive parameters. More details can be found at <<_node_properties_in_directives>>.

==== Under the hood

On the server, one or more properties files are written for each node in the
`/var/rudder/share/<uuid>/rules/cfengine-community/properties.d/` directory.
This directory is then synchronized by the agent with all other promise files.

In the agent, properties are made available in the `node.<namespace>` container that contains the values.
Those values are read from
`/var/rudder/cfengine-community/inputs/properties/*.json`. All files are taken
in order and override the previous ones - the last one wins.

Each file must contain at least 2 levels of JSON content, the first level is the namespace level
and the second level is the key level.

The namespace name must be an ASCII name that doesn't start with `_` and must
match the following regex: `[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`

For example: 

----

{ 
  "properties": 
  {
    "datacenter": "Paris",
    "environment": "production",
    "customer": "Normation"
  }
}

----

The merge is a first level merge done at the namespace level. This means that:

* a key in a namespace is fully overridden by the same key in the same namespace in a later file.
* a key in a namespace is never overriden by the same key in a different namespace
* a key that is overriden never retains original data even if it is a data container itself

The result key is available in the `node.<namespace>` data variable. A usage
example:

----
${node.properties[datacenter]}
----

To get the original data (for debug only) there is the
`properties.property_<fileid>` variable. A usage example:

----
${properties.property__var_rudder_cfengine_community_inputs_properties_d_properties_json[properties][datacenter]}
----
